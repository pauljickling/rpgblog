title: "Simplifying Random Encounters"
---

I've seen a variety of methods of handling random encounters in various games and in various blogs, and it all feels like more bookkeeping than is worth the trouble to me.

My first observation is that there isn't really any need to roll for random encounters contemporaneously. Since random encounters are by design not player-facing rules that they engage with, you can simply roll random encounters into part of your prep before a session.

Another observation is that it's preferable to roll a couple of dice as opposed to a lot of dice. I've seen a lot of OSR systems with encounter dice where the GM is rolling every turn to check for encounters. That's... a lot of rolling. I would instead suggest that when creating regions that the party is exploring you establish two values: one is the encounter table for the area, and the other is a frequency rate for those encounters, which is just a die value. Roll that die value a couple of times, whatever seems reasonable, and record the results. Random encounters happen in those increments. You can roll those encounters from the encounter table now, or later if it makes more sense to do that in the moment. For example, in a small dungeon crawl experience with a limited biome you can probably safely roll in advance, whereas for overland travel where it is less clear what kind of environment the party will be in when the encounter happens it makes sense to roll when the encounter happens.

My thinking along these lines is from the player's perspective it doesn't really matter if the random encounters are pre-destined in a sense. If random encounters are a feature of play, it makes no difference if they happen in the moment, or were created in advance. And there is still an element of unpredictability since even if as the GM I know that the players will always have an encounter on turn 7, that doesn't mean I know the location of where the players will be by then, and that location could end up impacting the nature of an encounter. Are they in a room with lots of defensive cover, or in the middle of trying to cross a rickety bridge?

Since the world is not necessarily static, it is conceivable that the players could take actions that impact how often one should expect encounters to happen. No matter, the nice thing about a low effort system is it is easy enough to scrap the results, and roll up some new ones, modifying the encounter roll die as appropriate.
