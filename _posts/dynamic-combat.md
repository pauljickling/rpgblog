Combat in tabletop RPGs can fall flat in several different ways. One is by being so simplistic as to be completely uninteresting.

*Player: I attack the guard with my metal baseball bat.*

*GM: Okay, make a sports skillcheck.*

*Player, rolling a 16: I pass*

*GM: Okay, the guard is dead.*

Lots of story and narrative focused RPGs will more or less work like this. It's up to the players and GM to inject some drama into the dice roll. In Powered by the Apocalypse games, and games inspired by those types of games, the NPCs never roll dice. Instead, players just suffer consequences from failed (or mixed success) rolls. There's a certain virtue in this, it cuts out the tedium of rolling lots of dice. We don't care whether a specific sword attack hits or not, we just want to what the next outcome is. Because the alternative is the other way RPG combat can fall flat: by being completely and utterly tedious.

*Player: I make my attack roll and roll a 7, I miss.*

*GM: The killer robot also makes its attack roll, and rolls a 14. Since you have such a high evasion it also misses.*

*7 turns later...*

*GM: Alright, it finally makes a hit and does 12 points of damage.*

*Player: I use my healing beam to negate that damage.*

*GM: Alright, back to where we started...*

Even if you have a really tactically sophisticated combat system in a game, if it drags out for too long everyone will get bored. There are several obvious culprits here, and they all have the same problem: prolonging the resolution of the scene without changing the state of the conflict. So things like: missing attacks, huge HP pools, and healing spells and effects all will drag things out.

Another potential problem is a lack of verbs for a player.

*GM: You come face to face with a 14 foot demon.*

*PC: Well, I am a fighter, so I swing by sword.*

*6 turns later...*

*PC: I swing my sword yet again.*

I've been in games that play out like that where the GM insists that I should be describing what happens in great detail and making things as dramatic and exciting as possible for everyone at the table. The problem with this is the mechanics aren't supporting that drama. I'm just doing the same thing over and over again and hoping the numbers turn out good. There's also an information asymmetry. Typically players will have no idea how close to death their opponent is. It will feel ridiculous to say, "I grab the demon by the neck and slit its throat, watching it bleed out..." if it turns out I've barely made a dent in its HP pool.

Even if a game is tactically rich, drives towards resolution, and gives players interesting choices every turn, there is one other risk at play: complexity. Most people playing RPGs have an appetite for complexity: look at how many people play D&D. But how many complex games are people willing to learn? Maybe a few. But at a certain point asking people to learn a new game will lead to friction. Should they spend time learning this new thing? Or would people rather stick with what they know?

So when creating a combat system that can work for as many tables as possible, we want it to have the following properties:

1. It isn't as simple as making a skill check, there should be some real friction at play.
2. Actions should drive towards a resolution. There shouldn't be unnecessary delays, or even worse, extending the time until a resolution.
3. Players should have interesting choices that they have to evaluate each turn. Ideally there shouldn't be a default choice, or if there is, it isn't something the players lean on too much.
4. There shouldn't be so much complexity that people won't bother to learn to play the game. A game can't be fun if no one plays it.

The good news is none of these objectives are in direct conflict with each other, so in theory at least, coming up with a satisfactory system seems viable. From these desired properties we can infer some other details about the system. For example, since we want some friction we can assume that the enemy combtatants will be making moves as well, irrespective of the players' actions. We should also have rules that drive a resolution forward. In fact, we can do this by setting a hard limit on how long combat goes on for. Lets say three rounds. Why three? No particular reason, but it works nicely in terms of narrative strucuture: there's a beginning, middle, and end. And tactically it follows the structure of opening move, strategic adjustments, resolution. We can return to making sure there are tactically interesting decisions in a moment, but I want to first jump to the last point first. How can you reduce cognitive overload in a tactically rich system?
