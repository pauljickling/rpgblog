title: "Most people are doing random generation wrong"

There are several ways random tables get misused in tabletop games:

- They introduce narrative incoherence
- The results are too specific to introduce into a generalized situation
- The results are too generic to introduce any sort of interesting element to play
- They rob players of agencies by applying effects without an opportunity to respnd in anyway. Random effects from spells, poisons, traps, etc. are the real culpit here.
