title: "Vaarn Settlements"
---

Since water is the currency of Vaarn, we can quickly judge the relative power of a settlement based on its access to water. Roll 2d6 for a bell curve effect.

| Die Roll | Water Access | Security | Trade/Economy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2-4 | No access to water, settlement is on the verge of collapse | None | None |
| 5-6 | Barely sustainable | Small, poorly equipped volunteer force | Minimal offerings and give highly favorable trade to water rations, and poor trades to anything else |
| 7-8 | Just enough | An assigned warden and a small group of well trained guards | Trades are made fairly, increased variety of goods, but nothing too exotic available and the capacity to trade for such items is limited |
| 9-10 | Surplus | A well trained force is able to provide protection across the entire settlement | Specialized merchants exist, and have the capacity to make favorable trades for any highly desired items |
| 11 | Relatively abundant | A small, private army is employed by the settlement, and they have the capacity to engage in warfare with neighboring forces | An abundance of goods & services are available for service here. |
| 12 | Monopoly | Substantial military power, the settlement is a local regional superpower | All types of goods & services are available here, things that cannot be purchased elsewhere, but everything is exorbitantly expensive and heavily regulated by water monopolists. |

### Rumors & Quests

Settlements with no access to water will always be completely focused on existential survival. For other kinds of settlements, the following types of quests and/or rumors might be available. Roll up 1-3.

1. A piece of exotica was stolen by a neighboring faction. Steal it back.
2. There are rumors of an ancient historical site nearby. It is some distance from another known site. Go discover it, and (if you dare) explore it.
3. Local religious figures will provide their services to you, but first you must make a pilgrimage to a sacred site and pray at a particular altar. Alternatively they ask you desecrate a heretical shrine.
4. Help with a secret plot such as planting a particular item on an NPC
5. Escort a trade caravan to a neighboring settlement
6. Survey an area and report back
