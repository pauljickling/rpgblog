title: "Complicating Random Encounters"
---

I previously wrote about [simplifying random encounters](https://blog.gundamdialectics.com/2023/08/29/simplifying-random-encounters.html). Today I want to talk about complicating them. I'm being tongue-in-cheek here, what I mean is that in my previous blog post I discussed ways to simplify the procedure for random encounters taking place. Today I want to discuss how to complicate the actual random encounters themselves.

The random encounter the players will experience are typically rolled up from a table, and that's all there is to it. This is fine for games where the focus of the RPG experience is fighting almost everything you come across, but for less blood thirsty groups is less interesting. The first, and good step, is to make a reaction roll, not everything you come across has to be hostile. But we can also come up with a slightly more dynamic system by using a variation of the that old classic, [the overloaded encounter die](https://www.necropraxis.com/2014/02/03/overloading-the-encounter-die/).

| Roll | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Encounter with a single faction |
| 2 | Encounter with two different factions |
| 3 | Signs of future encounter |
| 4 | Supply loss |
| 5 | Change in local conditions |
| 6 | Roll 2d6 and combine results |

Most of these are fairly straight forward encounter die outcomes. When encountering two different factions you can roll a reaction die to see how the factions exist in relation to one another. To help set the scene you might also want to make a roll about what their hostilities or cooperation is about. Vaults of Vaarn has lots of tables for that sort of thing, but here are some general goals that are kind of generic and work in a variety of settings:

- Water
- To Get Somewhere
- Security/Additional Security
- Something
- Shelter
- Trading
- Locating Someone or Something

In general it is probably worth doing a mix of generic wants, and also your setting should have some unique aspects to it that drive NPC goals, so include some of those as well. By combining goals, attitudes, and factions it is often surprisingly interesting to come up with a unique story by making connections you previously might not have thought of.
