You can't do everything in a creative project, so you have to decide what is actually important to the work you are making. This is why the ideas of "pillars" is useful. What are the things that are important to this project, that make it what it is, and support everything else going one?

Here are my game design pillars.

## Offloading Work From the Table

RPGs are serious time commitments. And there are lots of RPGs out there. So if you want to maximize the odds that people are going to play your game instead of anything else out there, you need to do everything possible to make it as easy to play as possible. Some RPGs are so complex that they practically demand VTT software. I play Lancer, and that involves a mix of using a custom web app for character creation, a Foundry module, plus no small investment of my time as a GM designing maps, factions, etc. It's a wonderful game, but there's no question in my mind that it could have an even larger audience if there weren't so many potential barriers to entry for playing it.

## Definitive Resolution Combat

If you want combat to have some real weight to it both mechanically and narratively it should have mechanics that drive it towards resolution.

## Fun Character Customization

I've seen a lot of OSR games that have web apps where you go to the page, click a button, and it spits out a character for you to use. This comes from two aspects of the OSR philosophy: 1. Keep things as mechanically light as possible, and 2. Games will be lethal, so you should just roll a character and go with it.

Personally I hate these. Nothing makes me less excited about a new game then a GM messaging me telling me I can just go to some website to create a character, and then all I do is click a button. I want to actually make some choices about who I'm playing, and to imagine what it is like to play the game. By denying me this opportunity, you're draining the game of potential excitement.
