title: "Adventure Hooks Interrogate the Dungeon"
---

Luke Gearing argues that [you don't need hooks](https://lukegearing.blot.im/you-dont-need-hooks-you-have-been-lied-to). I'm entirely sympathetic to the argument. There are so many bad adventure hooks out there that it is easy to feel like, these are superfluous and unhelpful. Under no circumstances should a hook be the party picks up a quest marker from the quest board like they are in an MMO, come on people. But an adventure hook does serve a purpose, it provides an objective that orients how players interface with the dungeon. And so having several hooks is good, because it becomes a litmus test for the depth of the dungeon design. Does this hook change how the players interact with the dungeon? If not, either the hook is lacking in interesting detail, or the dungeon is, or both. Even if the GM opts not to use the hooks (valid choice!) I think it is still a good exercise to write hooks.
