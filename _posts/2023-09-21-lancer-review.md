Lancer is an RPG by Massif Press, an indie RPG publishing studio that is the collaboration between Tom Parkinson Morgan, the comic artist behind *Kill 6 Billion Demons*, and Miguel Lopez. Published in 2019, it's been in the top of the itch.io physical games category for as long as I can remember, so it is fair to say the game has been a huge success.

Lancer takes place in a science-fiction universe where humanity has successfully colonized the galaxy, and in the core parts of it successfully transitioned into a post-scarcity, post-capitalist society, but the laws of physics still work the way we understand them, there's no faster-than-light travel, and time dilation is a factor with space travel, so managing a territory of this size is this enormous logistical exercise. It is partially waved away with "paraphysics" (read: space magic), but the gist of it is that on the edges of this territory there are places where people aren't experiencing this new utopian society just because of the amount of time and energy it would take to transfer resources to these remote corners. These areas are probably where your players are going to be because your players are mech pilots, and there isn't really a good reason to be a mech pilot in a place where everything is going great. You can already see there are some tensions at play with the setting of the game.

In terms of play Lancer is two very different types of games mashed together. There is the tactical combat of the game, which comes from the lineage of 4th edition D&D. Overall this is really good stuff, the action economy is reminiscent of Firaxis's XCOM remake where you have a move action, and then can take two quick actions, or one full action, plus an overcharge action if you can risk the heat cost. It abstracts away a lot of the details of mech games of yore like Battletech and Heavy Gear where you are practically counting rivets while still being thoroughly crunchy. Overall the action economy is super nice, it takes away the monotony of combat encounters that can plague many D&D sessions of running lots of rounds of combat where nothing more happens then continually rolling to see if you hit and how much damage you do. There are always interesting tactical decisions to make, and because the action economy is structured the way it is, you don't have to necessarily sacrifice trying to damage an opponent or do something else interesting, you can usually do both things. 

The main criticisms for the tactical play section is that the hide actions has absurdly fiddly rules, and it isn't even clear if a game about piloting giant robots should really have rules for hiding. But the action economy of the game is tightly coupled with other parts of the game like rules for invisibility, and certain NPC mech mechanics, so trying to have a house rule that removes it from play also creates additional headaches for the GM. The other issue is that burn damage is just wildly more powerful compared to other kinds of attacks such that it can completely imbalance combat encounters. This is more easily house-ruled, but it is an odd aspect of the game where combat is so heavily the focus.

When not in combat the game runs a bit like a Blades in the Dark-lite experience with a bit of D&D's basic skill check resolution system thrown in instead of dice pools. There are skill triggers that give your pilots bonuses to performing certain kinds of actions, some skill checks can be risky or done with advantage, there are downtime actions, and... that's about it! There's some pilot equipment that a player can choose for their character, but since there is a lack of any real procedure for what the players should be doing when they aren't piloting mechs it tends to feel a bit superfluous.

Lancer sometimes comes in for criticism for having two different games jammed together. I don't think that is necessarily a problem, going back to the original X-COM it actually works quite nicely that there is the on the ground tactics game, and then the broader strategy layer. But in order for that kind of division to work the two parts need to create a good feedback loop for each other, and that's where Lancer really tends to fall flat. Defenders of the system will say that the parts of the game where players aren't piloting mechs are rules light so they don't get in the way of getting to the bits where robots are punching each other, but I find this pretty unsatisfactory because it takes away from what is actually interesting about mecha fiction.

The big joke about mech fiction (played for a really great laugh in the excellent series *Keep Your Hands Off Eizuken!*) is that giant robots don't actually make any real world sense. That is, we're never going to get to a future where people are piloting giant robots because there isn't any reason you would have someone pilot a mech instead of say, a tank, or a stealth bomber. They're just completely unsound from a mechnical/engineering/economic perspective. However fans of mech fiction are willing to completely ignore these very practical considerations because as an image mechs are an extremely potent metaphor for the military-industrial complex. And because of that you get to tell stories that are really rich and meaningful to a modern audience. Piloting a mech is a Faustian bargain that is impossible to refuse because you can achieve your goals or ideals from it even though it means creating massive destruction and creating new cycles of violence in the process.

Lancer, unfortunately, is not set up to effectively try and create these kinds of stories in its utopian, post-scarcity society. Lancer pilots are supposed to be super heroes essentially, they aren't the flawed, broken children that make upthe protagonists of Mobile Suit Gundam or Neon Genesis Evangelion. In doing so, you rob the game of the drama that is teed up for it by being about mech pilots.I suspect this is one of several areas where the game's roots in D&D tends to let it down.

Another issue where you see these two systems not really working together as intended is the short rest and long rest mechanics. These are another example of vestigial mechanics from D&D that haven't really been incorporated in any thoughtful way into the game. Long rests allow for a complete repair, while a short rest only allows for a partial recovery. This is supposed to help balance combat out because typically things are balanced firmly in the player's favor, but over time, in theory, things get more tense as more resources are exhausted, etc. The problem here is there is no real time economy in the part of the game where the players aren't in combat, no procedures by which players feel real pressure. In D&D the time pressure comes in the form of dungeon exploration mechanics, supplies and resources get exhausted, random encounters are rolled up, etc. Here there is no reason generally not to do a full rest unless the GM tells you not to? It isn't very satisfying.

Lancer in general seems unconcerned with the burdens it places on a GM. In addition to lacking procedures for running a game, the lack of battle maps included with the base game is shocking for one that is so focused on tactical combat. If I were to run the game in person, I would be at a complete loss of what to do.

The good news is that the community for Lancer has put together an enormous wealth of resources available for people interested in playing. The [COMP/CON web app](https://compcon.app/) makes creating and leveling up a character a breeze. The Lancer Foundry module is an amazing piece of technical work that takes out a lot of burdens that someone would normally face trying to actually run the game. And the community on the Lancer Discord has tons of resources for things like adventures, maps, additional NPC and mech builds, etc. This is a saving grace for a game that I would otherwise regard as practically unplayable. As it is, I was able to run a Lancer campaign for a year and a half, and had an amazing time with the game. But the amount of work that was required on my part as a GM did eventually wear me down, and I've moved onto running game systems that better respect my time as a human being. It's a fun tactics game, but at the end of the day I think I would be more excited if I heard someone was turning it into a computer game. The rules, as they exist, don't allow me to run the kinds of games I'm really interested in where there is a lot of room for player expressivity and creativity with an environment that is interesting to explore.
