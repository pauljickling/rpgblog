title: "Yet Another Random Encounter System"
---
In a previous post about [simplifying random encounters](./2023-08-29-simplifying-random-encounters) I essentially suggested instead of making lots of rolls, the GM could essentially pre-roll random encounters, and then record the results, and seed them into the game as necessary. That's certainly a viable approach, but there is another approach that requires less prep, which is always valuable for the busy GM.

1. Roll two dice.
2. One die is for the number of turns until an encounter happens (feel free to add a modifier depending on how dense or sparsely populated an area is)
3. The other die corresponds to the encounter chart.
4. If the party is noisy or does something to attract attention that would warrant rolling an additional encounter die.
5. After the encounter happens, repeat the procedure.

That's it! The only thing not covered here is the system you sometimes see where a roll of a 2 (or some similar mechanic) provides hints of an encounter to come. I have some thoughts about these foreshadowing mechanics, but I'm going to save them for a future blogpost. I will probably update this post once I've fully formed my thoughts.
