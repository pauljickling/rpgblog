The divine daemon are incomprehensible beings. They have consumed and appended the parts of mythical and fantastical creatures such that their forms are bewildering and humbling to mortals. They possess great vanity, and therefore appreciate the fealty and tribute received by mortals. Most drink the blood of cattle, although there are rumors of those that drink human blood and confer dark powers to the wretched. To the faithful they speak miracles and blessings.

A divine miracle can be acquired at a temple dedicated to the daemon. The centerpiece of every temple is a sacrificial altar where one bleeds out cattle or other tribute, and offers the feast to the daemon. Roll 1d20 adding +1 for each sacrifice that is at least the size of cattle. On a 21+ gain a random miracle. Any given daemon typically has 2 to 4 miracles to teach their devotees. Miracles typically reflect some aspect of the mythical creatures the daemon has consumed.

To use miracles a devotee must possess some sort of sacred relic. An object of significance from the priest caste of the daemon. Sacred relics vary in power, and affect the power of the miracle performed. 

At shrines the daemons accept other types of material tribute. Leave valuables at the shrine. Roll 1d6 and multiple that by 10 and the character's level. If the offering is of greater value in coin receive a blessing for the day.

Those with knowledge of miracles can pray at temples or shrines to reuse miracles that have previously been performed.

The economy of cattle for miracles has important dynamics on the world. It makes livestock rarer and more expensive. Polities form raiding parties to steal cattle from their neighbors. The peasantry are wary and fearful of the priest caste.
