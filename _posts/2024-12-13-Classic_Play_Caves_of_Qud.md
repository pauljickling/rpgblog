title: "Classic Play: Caves of Qud"
---
Caves of Qud 1.0 is out. As a game that is cribbing a lot from a Berlin-interpretation roguelike, it has a lot of DNA with tabletop RPGs. It is heavily influenced by the excellent Gamma World. And it has in turn been a big influence for the TTRPG Vaults of Vaarn. There are a couple of features that will be of interest to anyone running a classic style of tabletop play.

## Faction Play

Caves of Qud features a huge open world, with dozens of factions that have different relationships with them. You can alter your relationships by engaging in the water ritual with key characters, or by murdering key characters. When you do something favorable for one faction, it can have a negative impact on factions that dislike them, and vice versa. You can also learn various secrets, skills, and recipes from factions. How well disposed a faction is to you can have radical effects on the difficulty of certain areas of the world, so smart play requires some mindfulness of the potential consequences it will have on the world's factions.

## Mix of Procedural and Bespoke Content

One way Qud differs from roguelikes like Nethack or Angbang is there is a fixed storyline, although the player is free to move about and interact with the world, nothing is railroaded here. The world overall feels free flowing, with procedurally generated archeologies, texts, overworlds, settlements, etc. to surprise you, along with some fixed bespoke material that allows everything to gel into a meaningful gestalt.

## Rich Set of Interactions

Like all the best roguelikes, in Caves of Qud if you can think of something to try, you can probably do it. Just look at the list of [Steam Achievements](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Achievements)! Want to project your mind into the body of a goat? Eat a whole bear? Wear your own severed face on your face? There's a wealth of interactions that are worth stealing from as you consider your various trap and puzzle designs for a dungeon.

## Doesn't Play Fair

Caves of Qud isn't necessarily the hardest game out there, but if you dive into a situation you're not prepared for without a good escape plan, you will die, and quickly. Probably one thing I dislike is the amount of trash mobs in the game, but that's mostly a matter of taste. But the game is a good demonstration about how you can have a fair game to play without having to concern yourself with balanced encounters.
