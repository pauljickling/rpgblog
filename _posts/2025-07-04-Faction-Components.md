title: "Faction Components"

Factions are a staple of OSR adventures, but with a few exceptions most rulebooks don't have explicit instructions for how to construct factions, so how they are defined varies greatly. Good faction design introduces a greater degree of dynamism into an adventure by providing groups that the party can interact with and act as a hindrance or source of aid depending on the events that unfold in play. I will attempt to enumerate the most important components that are used to define factions, and provide examples from rulebooks and adventures that I think act as a good example.

## Components

### 1. Name

Lets start with an obvious one. A faction should have a name. Sometimes the name will be specific, a faction could be the Shadow Order of Accursed Flame, but a faction could also just be called "the bandits". The important thing is that by naming a faction, NPCs are then able to belong to the faction, or not. That which is not named does not exist, at least not socially.

### 2. Quantity

Every faction has an implicit or explicit quantity of NPCs belonging to that faction. Factions come in all sizes. A very powerful individual such as a dragon or wizard can act as a faction of one, or a faction could be an army of thousands. In Desert Moon of Karth, it states the "population" of each faction, and in the case of factions with class divisions, lists the numbers of each groups. It is more common to have a more vague sense of the quantity of a faction. Does the faction consist of a select few, some, a village worth, a hoard, etc.? How does that affect their behavior?

### 3. Goals & Desires

A faction should want things, and this is the most important aspect of a faction. Goals and desires make the faction open to negotiation. It also implicitly means the faction faces an obstacle that has kept that goal out of reach. Faction obstacles are probably under considered ideas, but thinking clearly about them is what will distinguish your faction as a dynamic force rather than a cliched video game style quest-giver. In Desert Moon of Karth it also lists fears for each faction, and these can also be considered a type of desire, in other words, a desire to avoid a particular outcome. Goals vary in terms of immediacy, but good faction goals should be specific, actionable, and have meaningful stakes. A band of knights might seek glory, but that is a banal goal unlikely to elicit concern from a party. On the other hand, if that band of knights plans to make a name for themselves by slaughtering a group of trolls, and those trolls will then obviously seek revenge on the neighboring village that the party is on good terms with, we now have a specific situation more likely to grab the party's attention.

### 4. Resources, Benefits & Advantages

Resources and benefits provide reasons for why NPCs might join a faction, and will color negotiations between players and the faction. Resources are things the players might utilize if they ally with the faction, and inversely threats they reckon with if they cross a faction. As with goals and desires, it is better if resources are specific and usable within the context of the game. For example, in Fever Swamp, it is said that the warriors of the Tree-Wearing House "are skilled ambushers, and their warriors have mastered the use of breathing-tubes to allow for amphibious attacks." One important resource that is often inadequately considered is knowledge. This is particularly relevant within the context of a dungeon crawl. What can a faction tell the party about the surrounding area?

### 5. NPCs

Factions consist of NPCs. Therefore it can be helpful to include a few specific NPCs that the party are able to interact with. Specific NPCs provide an opportunity to add some depth and texture to the faction, as NPCs can have different relationships and sets of goals to the faction at large. You can have a mix of specific characters and stock characters for a faction. In the first edition of Vaults of Vaarn, the factions of Gnomon all have leader NPCs that have six or so traits/characteristics, but also some stock rank-and-file type NPCs that just have standard NPC stat blocks.

### 6. Scope

Factions will possess different scopes depending on the needs of the table. Sometimes factions exist purely within the context of a single adventure, and other times they are a recurring feature of the social fabric of the campaign. The scope of the faction will determine the amount of care to detail that will also be demanded. Not every faction should be equally important, or recurring throughout sessions. It is much more manageable to have maybe 3 or 4 factions that recur through play, interspersed with minor factions that make brief appearances in adventures.

### 7. Ability to Take Action

Factions should have the ability to have an impact on the world. Otherwise they are just cheap props, and the game world will feel less alive. How factions have an impact on the world is an under-considered issue, although there are a couple of notable techniques. In Mausritter, between sessions the GM is instructed to roll a d6 for each faction, and on a 4+, they make some progress to their goal, which typically has between 2 to 5 progress pips. One can feel the influence of Blades in the Dark style clocks here. Additionally, players have the ability to advance or set back these progress pips through the course of play. So this strikes a balance between a simulation style of play where the world operates independently of the players, while also preserving the ability of players to have an impact on the game world.

Another technique is the use of conditionals. If a happens, then the faction does b, but if x happens, then the faction does y, if all else fails, then the faction does z. In Tomb Robbers of the Crystal Frontier, it describes what happens if any of the powerful NPCs achieve their goals, leave the dungeon, and so on. Conditionals are a powerful tool, but should be used sparingly. Going overboard with conditionals can lead to difficult to parse logic, and is also not the best use of prep time. After all, in the end the party will end up only making one choice, and it probably isn't one you anticipated anyway, and so every conditional considered that isn't utilized is in some way wasted time. Overall, it is better to have a clear sense of general principles of how the faction operates without trying to rigidly define its actions. Consider the resources it has at its disposal, and how it could try to use those resources to achieve its goals.

### 8. Relationships

Factions will have relationships with other factions, and they will have a relationship with the party. Relationships can either be fixed or in flux. Sometimes fixed relationships make more narrative sense, but in flux relationships are more interesting and more gamable, and so should be heavily preferred. Sometimes relationships are one-sided or mutual. That is, sometimes factions despise each other, but also sometimes one faction is envious of another faction, but that faction hasn't heard of the former faction. You can use goals to determine the relationship between the factions.

For factions with a long-term scope within the campaign, when interacting with players in place of a reaction roll, you can have a reaction index. In other words, there is a numeric score equivalent to a reaction roll that determines the faction's relationship to the party. As the party does things that the faction likes or dislikes, you adjust that score as appropriate.

### 9. Territory

One final consideration for factions is they occupy space in the world. Presumably the faction is not ubiquitious. Where can they be found? Do they have a lair or center of power, or are they nomadic? Where would it not make sense to see members of the faction, and if one were to see them there, what would that say about the state of the world? What does their existence in a particular place say about them? If in the context of a megadungeon, how does that affect the overall ecosystem of power in the mega-dungeon? Faction territory does not need to be explicitly defined, but is an opportunity to more carefully consider the material history of your game world.

## Final Thoughts

Factions are good, and as a GM you should use them. They introduce easy interactivity into your adventures, and don't necessarily require a ton of prep to create, although you should make sure they have specific features that will have an impact in your game. It is rare to see all the specific components laid out here when you read about a faction in an adventure. This doesn't necessarily make it a bad faction, but it does signal that there are some creative gaps you can fill as a GM to make a faction a more memorable and interesting experience at the table.
